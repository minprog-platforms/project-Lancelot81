# Scoresheets
### The easiest way to keep score during cardgames!

What makes cardgames so popular? It is probably the fact that they are well known and that you don't need to have much with you to play them.
In fact, for most games one might only need to have a deck of cards. For some, however, one also needs something to keep score with,
be it a pen and a piece of paper or a very easy-to-use web application!

In this web application, one can choose between multiple tabs containing different cardgames.
On these tabs, specifically designed for these games, it will be very easy for the user to track scores.
The app will also contain some custom scoresheets, which can be used when players require a different way to track scores.

## Prerequisites

    * Some package to manage a database: SQL and flask
    * bootstrap for designing properties and buttons
